## Discussion

I used the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, React, Jest, and Enzyme.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4)
to generate the scaffolding for this app.

## Requirements

Build a responsive web application that allows a user to quick filter a list of things. The top of the page will have a search input field and below it a list of things. The top of the page will have a search input field and below it a list of things in response to the filter sorted alphabetically. The things should be AJAX pulled from an open public API.

I used axios within React to get the JSON posts data from Reddit API. The search
input field will be used to query subreddit topics.
